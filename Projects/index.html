            <h3>pianoFirst</h3>
            <p><a href="http://anqibai.github.io/pianoFirst">PianoFirst</a> is a single-page application which allows users to play with the 88-key standard piano.</p>
            <p>First, try mouse click on the keys.</p>
            <p>Then, turn on the keyboard play mode, which allows the user to trigger multiple keys at the same time. (A tiny step tp approach the real piano.)</p>
            <p>A very simple game is available for the user to learn about the musical notations. </p>
            <h4>Try it!</h4>
            <p>When you are familiar with the musical notations, you may want to try on a real PIANO!</p>
  
            <h3>StemCellFluxx</h3>
            <p><a href="http://www.looneylabs.com/games/fluxx">Fluxx</a> is a very famous and interesting card game. And a group of students in CMU have developed a education verison of Fluxx, which targets K9-K12 students and conveys the basic concepts of stem cell engineering. (This is a project for the Stem Cell Engineering course in 2015 Fall at CMU.)</p>
            <p>Here is the gateway for <a href="http://fluxxstemcell.github.io/">StemCellFluxx</a>. This website provides a variety of resourses of stem cell and the game to help the teachers and students. Users can begin with the videos to get started with stem cell engineering or with the game. By playing the physical card game, the studnets will get familiar with the basic concepts in stem cell engineering, and get some intuitions of how the stem cell therapies work.</p>
            <p>The card game StemCellFluxx and all the website content are of team work. I am the coder of the website(organizing the webpages and adding the utilities).</p>
